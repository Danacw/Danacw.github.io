Winding up in a data science career is both expected and a surprise to me. Let me explain. 

During grammar school and high school, I was always good at math, scoring well in the most advaced courses offered, participating in Mathletes, and quickly picking up what little coding I was exposed to. When I learned HTML (in the 1990s), I was so fascinated that a few lines of code could allow me to communicate with seemingly the entire world. I hoped to have a career as a Webmaster. 

I started college with plans to major in Computer Science. Unfortunately, my first class didn't go well, and I was both bored an intimidated by the thought of continuing that coruse of study and whatever subsequent careeer it would lead to. I envisioned myself as someone who should have an impressive, glamorous career. 

I switched my major to Communication with the hope of working in Public Relations. But as I learned quickly after graduation, most jobs in PR are in pretty unglamorous industries. I also realized I didn't enjoy writing or public speaking, or really anything that was a necessary task in PR or marketing communication. 

However, I had no idea what else to do. I took some classes in the hopes of figuring out a better career path. First graphic design, but had similar feelings as I did writing. I took Calculus, refreshing what I learned in college. I greatly enjoyed it, and considered a career in engineering, but wasn't sure I wanted to start over from square one with a second bachelors in civil engingeering. 

I transitioned to digital marketing, and with that came some data analysis, which I greatly enjoyed. I was reminded how much I loved math. I learned as much as I could on the job so that I could get the most insight out of what little data was available. That was recognized, and eventually, during a team reorganization, I was moved into a role focused 100% on marketing analytics. 

Luckily, I was working under someone experience in that area, who could start to expose me to (and teach me) what I didn't know about the world of analytics, statistics, and programs like R. Learning R reminded me that I liked writing code and how cool I thought it was that a few lines of code could be so powerful. 

I was fascinated with everything about analytics and I wanted to learn more. I was much more excited by this type of work than I ever was about PR or marketing. 

Eventually, I realized if I wanted to move up in the area of analytics, I had a lot of skill gaps to cover. A liberal arts degree focused on Communication does not prepare one for quantitative analysis. To that end, I enrolled in a Masters of Data Science program, while continuing to work full-time. 

So, in the end, despite my best efforts, I still ended up in a career that combined my math skills and interest in coding. The upside of my detour into communication, public relations, and marketing is that I was able to significantly improve my communication skills, which probably would not have happened had I followed my original path starting with Computer Science.
