Product Analytics Data Scientist in the Travel Tech industry. 

About Me
======

Naturally curious and observant. Thrives on new challenges and never stops seeking out learning opportunities and sharing knowledge.

I enjoy solving problems with data, whether that is a personal problem, like creating [my own recommender model to figure out what to wear when running through another chilly Chicago winter](https://github.com/maggiewolff/graduate-studies/tree/main/Recipe-Recommender), or on the job, using data to create better user experiences for corporate travel booking.

My current work typically includes advanced analysis, A/B (hypothesis) testing, predictive analytics, and defining new metrics. I also enjoy knowledge sharing with colleagues and mentoring others.

I pivoted to analytics in 2016, after working in marketing and communication roles (which included some data analysis) for over a decade. I've always loved math and logic, and I draw on my previous experience when communicating the complex messages I find in data.

Currently working full-time in the travel tech industry analyzing user experiences for a corporate travel booking platform. Recently finished my MS in Data Science. Ambassador for [Women in Data Science (WiDS)](http:/www.widsconference.org). Currently overseeing a mentorship program via [Data Angels](https://twitter.com/data_angels), a Slack community for women in data.
