About Me
======

I pivoted to analytics after 10+ years in marketing and communication. I've always loved math and logic, and I draw on my previous experience when communicating the complex messages we find in data.

I am especially interested in helping to create better user experiences through advanced analysis, A/B (hypothesis) testing, and predictive modeling via machine learning methods. I enjoy partnering closely with stakeholders and leadership to answer questions and solve business problems, as well as mentoring others.

I'm experienced in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target.

Currently working full-time in the travel technology industry while enrolled in graduate school part-time. I love connecting with other folks in the data science & analytics space as well as other women in tech. Feel free to connect or contact me via LinkedIn.
