About Me
======

Naturally curious and project-oriented. Thrives on new challenges, creative solutions, and opportunities to learn and share knowledge with a collaborative team.

Naturally curious and project-oriented. Thrives on complex challenges, creative solutions, and opportunities to learn and share knowledge with a collaborative team.

I enjoy using data to drive decision making, whether it’s personal, such as building [my own recommender system] (https://github.com/Danacw/DiversityInFilm_DemoDay) to decide what movies to watch, or business-related, such as [segmenting e-commerce customers] (https://github.com/Danacw/Customer_Segmentation) based on purchase behavior. 

With a background in both analytics and project management, I use holistic approaches to build assessments from conception to completion. From weighing pain points and defining key performing indicators to building project goals and timelines.

I’m currently looking for opportunities to work for a large to mid-sized organization on a data-driven team. I actively participate in [Women in Data Science Worldwide] (https://www.widsworldwide.org/) and [Women in Data] (https://www.womenindata.org/) and enjoy connecting with others in data roles.

<!-- I enjoy using data to drive decision making, whether that is a personal problem, like creating [my own recommender model](https://github.com/maggiewolff/running_clothes_recommender) to figure out what to wear when running through another chilly Chicago winter, or on the job, using data to create better user experiences. Recently I looked at the impact of [user effort on business outcomes](https://github.com/maggiewolff/user-effort-index/blob/main/IDEAL%20-%20Maggie%20Wolff%20-%20User%20Effort.pdf). 

My current work typically includes advanced analysis, A/B (hypothesis) testing, predictive modeling, and defining new metrics. I also enjoy mentoring and [knowledge sharing](/talks/) with colleagues and others in the industry.

I pivoted to analytics in 2016, after working in marketing and communication roles (which included some data analysis) for a decade. I've always loved math and logic, and I draw on my previous experience when communicating the complex messages I find in data.

Currently working in the travel tech industry analyzing user experiences for a corporate travel booking platform. Holds an MS in Data Science. Ambassador for [Women in Data Science (WiDS)](http:/www.widsconference.org). Organizer for [MeasureCamp Chicago](https://chicago.measurecamp.org/). Also oversees a mentorship program via [Data Angels](http://dataangels.org/), a Slack community for women in data.
