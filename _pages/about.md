About Me
======

I love connecting with other folks in the data science & analytics space as well as other women in tech.

I enjoy partnering with stakeholders and leadership to answer questions and solve business problems, especially when it comes to helping to create better user experiences. My current work typically includes advanced analysis, A/B (hypothesis) testing, and I am trained in using predictive modeling and machine learning algorithms. I also enjoy knowledge sharing with colleagues and mentoring others, and have recently started using social media to share my story and advice on a career in analytics. 

I'm experienced in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target. 

I pivoted to analytics 6 years ago, after working in marketing and communication roles (which included some data analysis). I've always loved math and logic, and I draw on my previous experience when communicating the complex messages we find in data.

Currently working full-time in the travel technology industry. Recently finished my MS in Data Science. As I transition from part-time graduate student + full-time data scientist to "just" full-time data scientist, I am interested in taking on more challenges and leadership within analytics and travel tech while still being hands-on with my work.

Feel free to connect or contact me via LinkedIn.
