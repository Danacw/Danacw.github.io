About Me
======

Naturally curious and observant. Thrives on new challenges and never stops seeking out learning opportunities and sharing knowledge.

I solving problems with data, whether by creating my own personal recommender spreadsheet to figure out what to wear when running through another chilly Chicago winter. Or on the job, creating better user experiences for booking corporate travel. 

My current work typically includes advanced analysis, A/B (hypothesis) testing, predictive modeling, and defining new metrics. I also enjoy knowledge sharing with colleagues and mentoring others. 

I pivoted to analytics over 6 years ago, after working in marketing and communication roles (which included some data analysis) for over a decade. I've always loved math and logic, and I draw on my previous experience when communicating the complex messages we find in data.

Currently working full-time in the travel technology industry. Recently finished my MS in Data Science. Ambassador for Women in Data Science. Currently running a mentorship program via Data Angels, and Slack community for women in data.
