About Me
======

I pivoted to analytics over five years ago, after working in marketing and communication roles. I've always loved math and logic, and I draw on my previous experience when communicating the complex messages we find in data.

I am especially interested in partnering closely with stakeholders and leadership to answer questions and solve business problems, especially when it comes to helping to create better user experiences, through advanced analysis, A/B (hypothesis) testing, and predictive modeling via machine learning algorithms. I also enjoy knowledge sharing with colleagues and mentoring others. 

I'm experienced in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target. 

Currently working full-time in the travel technology industry while enrolled in graduate school part-time (target graduation date: June 2022). I love connecting with other folks in the data science & analytics space as well as other women in tech.

Feel free to connect or contact me via LinkedIn.
