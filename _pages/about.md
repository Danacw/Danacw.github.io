About Me
======

Naturally curious and project-oriented. Thrives on new challenges, creative solutions, and opportunities to learn and share knowledge with a collaborative team.

Naturally curious and project-oriented. Thrives on complex challenges, creative solutions, and opportunities to learn and share knowledge with a collaborative team.

I enjoy using data to drive decision making, whether it’s personal, such as building [my own recommender system](https://github.com/Danacw/DiversityInFilm_DemoDay) to decide what movies to watch, or business-related, such as [segmenting e-commerce customers](https://github.com/Danacw/Customer_Segmentation) based on purchase behavior. 

With a background in both analytics and project management, I use holistic approaches to build assessments from conception to completion. From weighing pain points and defining key performing indicators to building project goals and timelines.

I’m currently looking for opportunities to work for a large to mid-sized organization on a data-driven team. I actively participate in [Women in Data Science Worldwide](https://www.widsworldwide.org/) and [Women in Data](https://www.womenindata.org/) and enjoy connecting with others in data roles.  

Feel free to connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danacw/).
