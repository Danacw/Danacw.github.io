Project Goal: This project uses machine learning to recommend a more diverse array of films to users based off their individual preferences.  

Tasks: I used the Scikit Learn machine learning python library to build a similarity matrix using cosine similarity tools with data from The Movie Database. For each endpoint in our final Flask application, data was sorted by the percentage of female directed films, the percentage of foreign language films, and the percentage of lower budget films from 0 to 15 million dollars.
