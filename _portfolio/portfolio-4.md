Project Goals and Tasks 

Every season, when the weather changes, I feel like I have to relearn what to wear during the run in order to feel comfortable but not overheat - or freeze. I started keeping a log of what I wore on each run along with the weather conditions. Using the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, when getting dressed for a run, I can input the current weather conditions to get a recommendation for what I can wear that will keep my comfortable.
